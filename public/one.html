        <span class="intro">[Intro: JENNIE]</span><br>
        Lock me up and throw away the key<br>
        He knows how to get the best out of me<br>
        I'm no force for the world to see<br>
        Trade my whole life just to be<br><br>
    
        <span class="verse">[Verse 1: The Weeknd]</span><br>
        Tell nobody I control you<br>
        I broke you just to own you<br>
        They can't tell but I love you<br>
        'Cause you're loyal, baby<br>
        I love when you're submissive<br>
        You love it when I break skin<br>
        You feel pain without flinchin'<br>
        So say it<br><br>
    
        <span class="pre-chorus">[Pre-Chorus: Lily-Rose Depp]</span><br>
        Give me tough love<br>
        Leave me with nothin' when I come down<br>
        My kind of love<br>
        Force me and choke me 'til I pass out<br><br>
    
        <span class="chorus">[Chorus: Lily-Rose Depp]</span><br>
        We don't gotta be in love, no<br>
        I don't gotta be the one, no<br>
        I just wanna be one of your girls tonight<br>
        We don't gotta be in love, no<br>
        I don't gotta be the one, no<br>
        I just wanna be one of your girls tonight, oh<br><br>

        Lock me up and throw away the key<br>
        He knows how to get the best out of me<br>
        I'm no force for the world to see<br>
        Trade my whole life just to be<br>
        Top of the world, but I'm still not free<br>
        This is a secret that I keep<br>
        Until it's gone, I can never find peace<br>
        Waste my whole life just to be<br><br>
    
        <span class="final-chorus">[Chorus: All, The Weeknd, Lily-Rose Depp & JENNIE]</span><br>
        We don't gotta be in love, no<br>
        I don't gotta be the one, no<br>
        I just wanna be one of your girls tonight (Tonight)<br>
        We don't gotta be in love, no<br>
        I don't gotta be the one, no (Oh)<br>
        I just wanna be one of your girls tonight (Oh), oh<br>
