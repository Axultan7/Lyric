<h1>Cupid (Twin Version)</h1> 
<p class="lyrics">
    [Intro: Aran]<br>
    La, la, la, la-la-la<br>
    La, la-la-la, la, la-la-la<br><br>

    [Verse 1: Aran, All]<br>
    A hopeless romantic all my life<br>
    Surrounded by couples all the time<br>
    I guess I should take it as a sign<br>
    (Oh, why, oh, why, oh, why, oh, why?)<br><br>

    [Pre-Chorus: Sio, All]<br>
    I'm feelin' lonely (Lonely)<br>
    Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (Hold me)<br>
    Now I'm crying in my room<br>
    So skeptical of love (Say what you say, but I want it more)<br>
    But still, I want it more, more, more<br><br>

    [Chorus: All]<br>
    I gave a second chance to Cupid<br>
    But now I'm left here feelin' stupid<br>
    Oh, the way he makes me feel that love isn't real<br>
    Cupid is so dumb<br><br>

    [Verse 2: Aran]<br>
    I look for his arrows every day<br>
    I guess he got lost or flew away<br>
    Waiting around is a waste (Waste)<br>
    Been counting the days since November<br>
    Is loving as good as they say?<br><br>

    [Pre-Chorus: Sio, All]<br>
    Now I'm so lonely (Lonely)<br>
    Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (Hold me)<br>
    Now I'm crying in my room<br>
    So skeptical of love (Say what you say, but I want it more)<br>
    But still, I want it more, more, more<br><br>

    [Chorus: All]<br>
    I gave a second chance to Cupid<br>
    But now I'm left here feelin' stupid<br>
    Oh, the way he makes me feel that love isn't real<br>
    Cupid is so dumb<br><br>

    [Post-Chorus: All]<br>
    (Cupid is so dumb)<br><br>

    [Bridge: Aran, Sio]<br>
    Hopeless girl is seeking<br>
    Someone who will share this feeling<br>
    I'm a fool<br>
    A fool for love, a fool for love<br><br>

    [Chorus: All, Aran, Sio]<br>
    I gave a second chance to Cupid<br>
    But now I'm left here feelin' stupid<br>
    Oh, the way he makes me feel that love isn't real<br>
    Cupid is so dumb<br>
    I gave a second chance to Cupid (Hopeless girl is seeking someone)<br>
    But now I'm left here feelin' stupid (Who will share this feeling)<br>
    Oh, the way he makes me feel that love isn't real (I'm a fool)<br>
    Cupid is so dumb (A fool for love, a fool for love)<br>
